# python_hangman
This is the project that I have from Codecademy. It's an exercise on using Git and Python.

# How to run
clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BradGaddis/python_hangman/
```
simply run the Main.py file in your terminal


# The rules
 Player 1 gets to choose 5 words. 1 word will be choosen at random. Each word will be between 4 and 8 characters long

Player 2 must select letters in the word that is presented. It will be presented as a series of underscores.
 
The number of wrong gueses you get is equal to the chosen word + 3. You get three extra guesses.

For each letter that player two guesses wrong, an additional body part will be drawn in

If the entire man is drawn in, player two loses. Otherwise player one loses.
