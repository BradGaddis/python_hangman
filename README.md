# python_hangman
This is the project that I have from codecademy. It's an exercise on using git and Python.

# The rules
There are two players in this game. 

Player 1 gets to choose 5 words. 1 word will be choosen at random. Each word will be between 4 and 8 characters long

Player 2 must select letters in the word that is presented. It will be presented as a series of underscores

For each letter that player two guesses wrong, an additional body part will be drawn in

If the entire man is drawn in, player two loses. Otherwise player one loses.
